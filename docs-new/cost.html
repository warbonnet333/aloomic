                                The process of developing an app is a journey that doesn’t happen all at once. Whether
                                you are an Android or iOS app developer or an Android or <a
                                    href="/service/ios-app-development">iOS app development</a> company, mobile
                                applications take time, labour, and, of course, finances to develop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While in the earliest stages of app development, several questions must be asked and
                                answered before any work can begin. One of the most important of these questions is ‘how
                                much will this cost?’ The answer to this question varies depending on many factors.
                                Nevertheless, a reliable estimate must be settled upon before mobile apps development
                                can
                                begin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The answer to this crucial inquiry can make or break the development of an app as it
                                directly involves the budgeting and labour distribution for the upcoming project. That
                                is
                                why the question of development cost must be addressed and answered at such an early
                                stage
                                of development.

                            <h2>Getting An Estimate For Mobile Apps Development</h2>
                            <p>
                                Your Android and iOS development costs are heavily dependent on many different factors.
                                These factors are relevant whether you decide to carry out development in-house or hire
                                a
                                mobile apps development service. A good estimate for the cost of developing your mobile
                                app
                                takes all of these factors into consideration as they pertain to you and your app.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On average, it could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $300,000 to develop your app. That is
                                a
                                very wide range! That is why getting an estimate is non-negotiable. With a reliable
                                estimate, you can properly budget for your mobile apps development according to the
                                stages
                                of development and factors that pertain to your app.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Factors Involved In Costing For Mobile Apps Development</h2>
                            <p>
                                Many factors go into the final cost of mobile apps development. Elements of the app such
                                as
                                what operating system it's designed for or the complexity of its functionality can have
                                effects that hugely impact the final cost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some key factors that influence the final cost of development are listed below.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Type Of App</h3>
                            <p>
                                The function of an app is very important in determining many parts of the development
                                process, including the development cost. The type of app influences the number of
                                features
                                the app requires, the design process, the length of development time, and other factors.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>A simple or basic app: These are apps like clock or notes apps which would be
                                    relatively
                                    cheap to develop. Simple apps do not need any backend development or network
                                    connection,
                                    resulting in shorter development time. They can cost about $10,000-$15,000 in total
                                    to
                                    develop.
                                </li>
                                <li> Personalised data apps: These apps make use of user authentication to operate. They
                                    store data based on user input and present it to users. Examples of these are

                                    apps for stores. These apps require more complicated coding and therefore, cost more
                                    to
                                    develop. They can cost around $40,000-$80,000 to develop.

                                <li>Social applications: These are very complex applications that work exclusively with
                                    network connections and require an intense backend development. Social apps like
                                    Facebook are incredibly complex and handle large amounts of data as well as offer a
                                    wide
                                    range of features for users. Social apps can cost from $60,000-$300,000 to develop,
                                    depending on the features included in the application.

                                <li>Marketplace platforms: Marketplace applications serve as platforms for a variety of
                                    service providers to connect with customers. These marketplace apps involve
                                    commercial
                                    functions as well as social. These apps provide a direct line to different services
                                    as
                                    well as avenues for communication and payment between the service provider and user.
                                    Apps like these can cost about $150,000-$300,000 to develop.

                                These are just a few types of apps and their estimated costs. The cost of your app will
                                be
                                determined by your app type and the rates of your developers.

                            <p>
                                n-house development may seem like the more cost-friendly and efficient option but it has
                                its
                                pros and cons as outsourced development does. The benefit of outsourcing a development
                                team
                                is that the hired team has more experience and may have a more advanced method of
                                development than your in-house development team may have. This is especially relevant if
                                you
                                are a small company developing an app or it is your first time developing an app.

                                In the case of outsourced labour, the location of your developers also plays a role in
                                your
                                android and iOS development costs. The average mobile apps development service will
                                probably
                                charge per hour so let’s take a look at average hourly rates for different geographical
                                locations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Australia - $92/hour <br>
                                North America - $150/hour <br>
                                United Kingdom - $71/hour <br>
                                Central Europe - $40/hour <br>
                                India - $26/hour <br>
                                South America - $43/hour
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your outsourced development can come from a small or large firm or a specialist company.
                                These also affect the cost of mobile apps development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Small firms are the cheapest source of mobile apps development labour and are ideal for
                                apps
                                that are not too complex. A specialist firm may charge significantly higher than others
                                but
                                this is because of the quality of work they produce. Large firms have the advantage of
                                experience and resources but also demand high payment.
